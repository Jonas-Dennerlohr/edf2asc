# Eyelink EDF to ASCII conversion on Windows

Place all .edf files in the x directory. (Extension must be lowercase.) From the terminal, run the following at the path of the x directory:
sh e2a.sh

The .edf file(s) will be in the edf directory, while the asc directory will have the .msg (events) and .dat (eye tracking data) files in ascii format.
